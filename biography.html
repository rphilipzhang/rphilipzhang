<h2><font size= "4">Experiences</font></h2>
<h3><font size= "3">Pre-College</font></h3>
<p><font size="3">
I was born and raised in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu" target="_blank">Chengdu</a>, a city famous for its <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sichuan+scenery&hl=en&newwindow=1&prmd=imvns&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=bH5wUJC0OIjFyAGzjID4BA&ved=0CB0QsAQ&biw=1745&bih=868"target="_blank">beautiful scenery</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szechuan_cuisine" target="_blank">delicious food</a>, and <a href="http://www.chinatravel.com/sichuan/history.htm" target="_blank">long history</a>. Spending my first 18 years in one of the most livable cities in China, I enjoyed my childhood very much. More importantly, I really appreciate my parents' tremendous efforts in inspiring my intellectual curiosities in appreciating and creating knowledge, which have later driven my potential as a professional researcher. From September 2001 to June 2007, I attended <a href="http://www.cefls.cn/index.php/cate/index?cid=62" target="_blank">Chengdu Experimental Foreign Languages School (CEFLS)</a> for my high-school study. During my study in CEFLS, I was (and still am) fascinated by the beauty of mathematics and physics, and by their compelling power to understand our God-made world. I won several prizes in contests in mathematics and physics, one of which was the first prize in Chinese Mathematics Olympiad. It was this prize that enabled me to waive the national college entrance exam and get admitted to the <a href="http://www.im.pku.edu.cn/"target="_blank">Department of Information Management</a>, <a href="http://www.pku.edu.cn" target="_blank">Peking University</a>. In September 2007, I left Chengdu and became an undergraduate student in Peking University.

<img  src="PKULogo.png" alt="20 in" width="20 in" /> Peking University
</font></h3>
<p><font size="3">
After the freshman year of my undergraduate study at Peking University, I have decided to advance my study in mathematics. As a result, in June 2008, I transferred to the <a href="http://www.math.pku.edu.cn" target="_blank">School of Mathematical Sciences</a>, Peking University. During my undergraduate years, I focused my study on pure mathematics, with particular emphasis on analysis and probability. I also did some research on discrete geometry, number theory, and geometry of numbers under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://cam.tju.edu.cn/faculty/teacherDetail.php?id=53" target="_blank">Chuanming Zong</a>. From June 2009 to September 2010, my research on the discrete generalization of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AleksandrovsUniquenessTheorem.html"target="_blank">Aleksandrov's Projection (Uniqueness) Theorem</a> was supported by the <a href="http://baike.baidu.com/view/1016713.htm"target="_blank">National University Student Innovation Program of China</a>. The final paper of this project can be downloaded <a href="Projection.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. 
<br/><br/>

<!---From May 2010 to October 2010, I worked with Doctor Sheng Liu from <a href="http://www.ruc.edu.cn/using " target="_blank">Renmin University of China</a> on an optimal dividend policy of an insurance firm based on stochastic control techniques (<a href="threshold.pdf"target="_blank">paper here</a>).--->

Throughout my last one and a half years of my undergraduate study, an intriguing question kept puzzling me: How to use mathematics to make better decisions? For the search of the answer to this question, I have put my main academic efforts to probability theory (and its applications) and operations research. I joined my B.S. thesis advisor, Professor <a href="http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/855996ad5f324e3fab6f1940a8566404/myHomePage.html" target="_blank">Ke Liu</a>'s research group in May 2010, and became a regular speaker in the group seminar until I left Beijing for Ph.D. study in July 2011. Under the supervision of Professor Liu, I finished my <a href="health.pdf"target="_blank">B.S. thesis</a> on a comprehensive review of the health care operations literature in June 2011. During my study and research in Professor Liu's group, I made up my mind to devote my career to the discipline of operations research and analytics.
<br/><br/>
During my undergraduate study, I also worked for several educational NGOs (e.g. China Rural Library and <a href="http://www.westsa.org/" target="_blank">Beijing Western Sunshine Rural Development Foundation</a>) in China, trying to help the students from the rural area of China. I help these organizations manage and serve their volunteers, as well as working as a volunteer myself.

My doctoral thesis research focuses on developing models and effective methodologies to address some fundamental operations issues (pricing, inventory control, capacity allocation, and procurement) under the emerging trends in technology, marketplace, and society (social networks, sustainability concerns, customer behaviors, and supply risks).

Since August 2016, I have been working at <a href="http://shanghai.nyu.edu/"target="_blank">New York University Shanghai</a> as an Assistant Professor of Operations Management. I am also affiliated with the operations management group at <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu" target="_blank">NYU Stern School of Business</a>, <a href="https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/cber"target="_blank">NYU Shanghai Center for Business Education and Research</a>, and
<a href="https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/datascience"target="_blank">NYU Shanghai Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</a>. At NYU, I teach master's students Machine Learning for Business, and undergraduate students Business Analytics and Operations Management. I am also a scholar and a practitioner in data science and operations research. My research addresses fundamental operations issues under the emerging trends in technology, marketplaces, and society. I am particularly enthusiastic about developing data-driven optimization and randomized experiment (a.k.a. A/B testing) methodologies to evaluate and optimize the operations strategies in the contexts of <b>online platforms and marketplaces</b>, <b>sharing economy</b>, and <b>social networks</b>, especially their <b>recommendation</b>, <b>advertising</b>, and <b>pricing</b> policies. My research works (<a href="research.html">downloadable here</a>) have appeared in <i><a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/opre" target="_blank">Operations Research</a></i> and <i><a href="http://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/msom" target="_blank">Manufacturing & Service Operations Management</a></i>, and have been recognized by various research awards of the INFORMS and POMS research communities. My research projects have been funded by <a href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/" target="_blank">NSFC</a>, <a href="http://edu.sh.gov.cn/" target="_blank">SMEC</a>, and <a href="http://stcsm.sh.gov.cn/" target="_blank">STCSM</a>.

In addition to my scholarly endeavor, I am also interested in creating a broader impact by connecting knowledge and practice. I am an economist and Tech Lead at <a href="https://www.kuaishou.com/" target="_blank">Kwai</a>, developing and implementing economics and data science frameworks to evaluate and optimize the ecosystem of the large-scale online video-sharing and live-streaming platform, its recommender system and advertising platform in particular.

In my spare time, I enjoy staying with my family and serving the God.
